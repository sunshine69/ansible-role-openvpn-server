# Default: /usr/local/openvpn_scripts
# openvpn_script_dir: /usr/local/openvpn_scripts

# List of vpn user to be created. The reset item is to reset the user with new
# password and qr if set to yes

# The qr image, profile will be generated in the server
# openvpn_script_dir/easy-rsa/generated. You can sync this to your local and automate the email procedures in the playbook

# Set it to True to recycle password and QR for all users in the system regardless of the field `reset` in the `vpn_users` var below
# vpn_reset_all_users_password: <yes|no>

# This var is similar like above but also reset all - that means the all certificates, users password etc will be cleaned and re-generated.
#reset_config: 'no'

# vpn_users - List of users to be created. If empty [] no users created. You can always add and re-run the role
# To recycle the vpn password and QR code, change the field `reset` (default is no).

# vpn_users_file - A path to a text file which can be used as a user list. The format is kind of free form - it will pick up the first email from the line from left to right to be used as email and use the first non space group match of the line as vpn username.
# If the line has the word `reset` then the user will have the reset attributes set to yes
# If the line has the word `state=delete` or `state=remove`, `state=absent` then the user will be removed
# List word you can add to the line is below. See the templates/easy-rsa/parse-vpn-users.py for complete pattern
# otp_enabled=(no|0) password_length=42
# Users list parsed will be added to the previous vpn_users vars.
